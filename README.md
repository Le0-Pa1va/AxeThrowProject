# Unreal Engine Axe Recall Project ðŸª“

Welcome to the Unreal Engine Axe Recall Project! In this project, I've recreated Kratos' iconic Axe Recall ability from the game God of War using Unreal Engine and C++. While the core functionality is implemented, animations are a work in progress.

## Features Implemented ðŸŽ®

- **Axe Throw:** Throw your magical axe at enemies or distant objects.
- **Recall:** Summon the axe back to your hand, just like Kratos!
